Configuration

Niffler stores user configuration locally in:

config.json


Key setting:

{
  "watch_folder": "path/to/your/root/folder"
}


This allows Niffler to be portable across machines and users.

Design Philosophy: Grounded Intelligence

Niffler intentionally prioritizes:

Accuracy over creativity

Grounded answers over fluent guesses

User trust over impressive-sounding output

This makes Niffler feel more like a knowledge steward than a chatbot.

If you’re looking for opinionated or imaginative responses, this project may not be the right fit — and that’s okay.

Known Limitations (Beta)

Voice interaction is functional but not yet robust

Search speed may degrade on very large folders

Answers may occasionally repeat or ramble slightly

No long-term memory or fine-tuning (yet)

These are known and expected at this stage.

Roadmap (High-Level)

🔊 Improved voice interaction (wake phrase + query)

⚡ Search performance optimizations

🧩 Pluggable embedding strategies

🧠 Optional synthesis / opinion modes

🧪 Expanded test coverage

📦 Easier packaging & installers

Final Note

Niffler exists because not all intelligence should be centralized, remote, or opaque.

Sometimes, the best assistant is one that simply knows your work — and nothing else.
